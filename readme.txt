Implemented a robust Selenium automation framework using C# and NUnit, following the Page Object Model (POM) for enhanced code maintainability. The 
framework supports data-driven testing, extracting data from JSON and Excel files to populate web forms, while also extracting table data to generate 
detailed Excel reports. Parallel testing was set up for efficiency, and parameterized annotations were used to handle diverse test scenarios, significantly 
improving testing productivity and reliability.
